Dear Hiring Manager:

My name is Brandon Thompson and I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer/Developer - Transportation position.
I am excited for the opportunity to work for Intelligent Automation because recently I have taken classes focusing on Machine Learning and am very interested in the topic.
I believe this position will help me develop my skills in the industry and further my knowledge.

Currently, I am attending Florida Polytechnic University and will graduate in the Spring of 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in cybersecurity.
Throughout my college career, I have taken classes such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and multiple programming classes that have taught me a lot about the development process and how to \dots

What attracted me most to FireEye was the contributions to high-profile security breaches like Target and Sony Pictures, that we have researched in class.
I look forward to meeting you to further discuss my qualifications and how I will be an asset to FireEye.
Thank you for your time and consideration.


Sincerely,

Brandon Thompson
