Dear Hiring Manager\\
\\
\\
My name is Brandon and I am writing to express my interest in the \position{} position at \company{}.
I am excited for the opportunity to work for \company{} because of the diversity of work, people, and the chance to improve my skills and knowledge.
I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, leading me to acquire a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification quickly out of college, as well as lead cybersecurity implementations at Manifold Analytics.

I discovered my interest in cybersecurity in college. From my highschool years in a FIRST robotics team I knew that I enjoyed working with electronics and coding and enjoyed disassembling devices to learn how they worked. When I applied to Florida Polytechnic University, the range of topics in the cybersecurity concentration peaked my interest because I wanted to demystify how the technology that we use every day works, much like when I would take apart electronics as a child.

I was initially hired at Manifold Analytics as an Algorithm Developer, upon being awarded a contract the company network needed to be compliant with NIST SP 800-171 requirements. I volunteered my cybersecurity knowledge to lead the implementation of NIST SP 800-171 STIGs enabling the company to take on contracts with SOCOM and other government entities. I continued to improve my knowledge in cybersecurity by completeing my degree and recieving a CEH certification shortly after. I am looking to continue to improve my skillset with other certifications and more cybersecurity-focused positions.

I look forward to meeting you to further discuss my qualifications and how I will be an asset to \company{}.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
\\
\\
\\
Sincerely,\\
Brandon Thompson
